## Description
To create an application that allows the user to create, save, and delete notes. The application does saves the notes even after exiting it, the notes need to be deleted in order to be removed from the database. Express node was used on the backend to save and retrieve the notes which were stored in a JSON file. 

## Actions Taken
* Utilized Express.JS back end to save and retrieve note data from a JSON file.
* Created API routing files to request and send responses from the server. 
* Create a server file set for the Express back end to handle data parsing and to listen to inputs. 
* Utilized Heroku to access the application via a live URL.
